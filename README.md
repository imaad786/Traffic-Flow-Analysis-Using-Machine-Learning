# Traffic-Flow-Optimization-Using-Machine-Learning
Prediction and optimization of the traffic flow is a subject of utmost importance. The Traffic Departments and the Governments could make use of the crucial data and key-points to interchange the vehicular routes and expedite the traffic movement in a smooth and effective manner. All the current and previous records and statistics pertaining to the vehicular traffic for a region can be utilized to identify the various road networks and the traffic patterns to predict the flow of the imminent and upcoming traffic. This data can prevent congestions in the near future and help scale down the overall travelling time for an individual.
